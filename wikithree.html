            <h2>1.Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) - India's Historic Space Achievement
                Introduction:
                
                </h2>
            <img src="images/isro26.jpg" alt="Apollo 11 Spacecraft">
            <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan, is India's first interplanetary mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on November 5, 2013. It was a significant milestone for India, making it the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first nation globally to succeed in its first attempt.
                <h3> Key Objectives</h3>

               <p> ⦁  To demonstrate ISRO's technological capabilities in deep-space missions.            </p>
               <p> ⦁	To study the Martian surface, morphology, mineralogy, and atmosphere.</p>
               <p> ⦁  To develop the capability to design and execute interplanetary missions.            </p>
             
                   
                </p>

            <h2>2.Launch and Orbital Insertion</h2>
           
           <p> ⦁	Launch Vehicle: PSLV-C25 (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle)</p>
           <p>⦁	Launch Site: Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, India</p>
            <p>⦁	Orbital Insertion: September 24, 2014 (after a 300-day journey)</p>
</p>
              <h2> Notable Achievements:</h2> <img src="images/isro22.jpg" alt="SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft">

              <p> ⦁	India became the first country to reach Mars orbit on its first attempt.</p>
              <p> ⦁	The mission was accomplished on an extremely modest budget of $74 million (₹450 crore), making it one of the most cost-effective Mars missions in history.</p>
              <p> ⦁	Mangalyaan provided crucial data about Mars, including the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere and details about Martian dust storms.</p>
              <p> Scientific Payloads: Mangalyaan carried five scientific instruments to study various aspects of Mars:</p>
              <p>  Mars Colour Camera (MCC): Captured stunning images of Mars and its moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>
                <p> Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS): Studied the composition and thermal properties of the Martian surface.</p>
                    <p> Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM): Searched for methane in the Martian atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP): Measured the escape of hydrogen and deuterium from the Martian atmosphere.</p>
              
              
                <h3>3. Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyzer (MENCA)
                 
                    </h3> 
                
               <p> ⦁	Limited budget required innovative solutions for spacecraft design and mission execution.</p>
               <p>⦁	Reliance on India's PSLV launch vehicle for the trans-Martian injection.</p>
                <p> ⦁	Coordination of complex orbital maneuvers to transfer Mangalyaan from Earth's orbit to Mars.</p>

            <h2>3.  Legacy
            </h2>   <img src="images/isro10.jpg" alt="SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft">
        
            <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission demonstrated India's capabilities in space technology and inspired millions worldwide. It laid the foundation for future interplanetary missions, including India's second Mars mission and plans for Venus exploration.
</p>
<p><b>End of Mission: </b>In October 2022, ISRO announced that Mangalyaan's mission had come to an end after nearly eight years of service, far surpassing its planned six-month lifespan. The spacecraft ran out of fuel and power, but its legacy as a symbol of India's space ambitions endures.
